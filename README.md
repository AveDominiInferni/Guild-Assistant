<h1>Guild Assistant</h1>
<h2>Guild bank and mail logging</h2>
Using the <a href="https://github.com/AveDominiInferni/GBMLogs">GBMLogs</a> addon for WoW 1.12 you can make logs of your guild bank characters and accounts. You can also log all donations through the mailbox.
<h2>Request system</h2>
It works like any ticket system. Members of the guild can request items from the guild bank and the request will be posted in an officer-only channel . To enable this module an admin has to use the /request command in the channel they want to use for request handling.
<h2>Loot council</h2>
It records all the loot and attendance for players and based on a simple formula calculates who should get the next item. All items are worth 1 point by default and adding your own values for each item will be available soon.
